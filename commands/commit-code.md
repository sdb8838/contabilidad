# Commit Code

Review the files that have changed, and create a commit with a commit message summrizing the changes made. Always try to give short and concise messages that convey the buisness logic.

Use user hints to be the message main subject $arguments. If no arguments are provided, use the default message "Update code". If the user provides a message, use it as the commit message.
